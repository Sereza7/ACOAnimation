Read the notebook "Animation.ipynb" for more information.
"Data" folder contains the outputs of this notebook.

## End of term report
New notebook "Refined ant algorithm.ipynb" with a more proper implementation of the algorithm.
"refinedData" folder contains the outputs of this notebook.

Added the Asset folder of the Unity project. There you can find all the ressources if you want to reuse my project or look at the final code.

A web build of this Unity app is available at https://sereza7.github.io/ACOAnimation/. However it's pretty heavy so you might need some tweaking on your browser parameters to run it. To run it locally, open "index.html" after downloading it alongside the folders "Build" and "TemplateData".

Video recordings of this projects are available here:
